# Programming Language II - Final Exam Exercises

This repository contains a collection of final exam exercises for the **Programming Language II** course.  
Each exercise focuses on core Python programming concepts such as **object-oriented design**, **data structures**, **searching and sorting**, and **randomized simulation**.

The exercises were implemented in Jupyter Notebook format for clarity and structured documentation.



## Contents

### Exercise 1-3: Searching and Sorting  
- Linear and Binary Search on lists of numbers and tuples.  
- Custom sorting using `key` functions.  
- Randomized dataset generation using `random`.  

### Exercise 4: Customer Class  
- Implementation of a class with attributes and methods.  
- Randomized generation of shopping lists.  
- Price calculation using dictionaries.  

### Exercise 5-7: Classes and Algorithms  
- Partitioning numeric intervals using uniform spacing.  
- Simulation of dice rolls with dictionary mappings.  
- String and list processing (word formation with given letters).  

### Exercise 8-9: Dictionary and Search Applications  
- Transformation of nested dictionaries (artworks by year).  
- Sorting and searching elements using mappings and search functions.  

### Exercise 10: Register Simulation (Supermarket Queue)  
- Object-oriented simulation of supermarket registers.  
- Dynamic handling of customers between queues using random events.  
- Practical application of `min()` and `max()` functions with `key` arguments.
